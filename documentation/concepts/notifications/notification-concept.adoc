= OpenTasks Notifications

This concept describes how notifications should be handled by OpenTasks.

[NOTE]
=========
*This document is work in process.*

*Open issues:*

* How to handle reminders of recurring events?
* Finish/revisit state diagram
* Undo notifications (to undo actions triggered from a notification)
* Notification texts (ticker text, title, description ...)
* Notification actions
* Notification layout (use inbox style to show task text?)
* Use of groups?
* Implementation details / design
=========

== Rationale

Android SDK level 26 significantly changes how notifications are managed. In order to show
a notification you need to create a channel and provide its ID when creating the notification.
Details can be found at
https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/notifiers/notifications[Notifications Overview].

We want to use this opportunity to rework and improve notification handling in general.

== Definition

By "task notifification" we mean a visual or aural signal to inform the user
about a certain task property or state transition, using Android's notification
framework.


== Requirements

=== Legacy API level support

A large amount of devices still uses Android API levels < 26 and its crucial to support older
Android versions.

==== Legacy notification layout

Notifications may look different on older devices than on newer ones.

==== Notification settings

On Android 8+ the system provides the UI to change notification sound, heads up display and
vibration settings. On older Android versions we need to maintain our own settings page.

==== Foreground service management

On Android 8+ a foreground service must explicitly enter foreground mode by calling
`startForeground` right after the the service has been started.

=== Group support

Certain types of notifications should be grouped if supported by the device.

TODO: The details still need to be worked out.

=== Efficiency

Notifications should not be updated more often than necessary and should reduce database
queries to the bare minimum. Especially since any task update could trigger or update
a notification it's essential to keep the overhead low in order to now slow down provider
updates.


== Notification sources

A notification source means a condition which is based on one or multiple
task properties and which results in a notification when it occurs.

At present there are six sources for notifications:

A task starts::

The start date of a task has just passed. TaskProvider sends a broadcast each time a task starts.

A task is due::

The due date of a task has just passed. TaskProvider sends a broadcast each time a task is due.

A task is pinned::

A task has been pinned, either in the UI, a notification or "remotely" by a sync adapter.

A task is unpinned::

A task has been unpinned, either in the UI, a notification or "remotely" by a sync adapter.

A task has been completed::

A task has been completed, either in the UI, a notification or "remotely" by a sync adapter.

A task has been deferred::

The task has been deferred, either in the UI, a notification or "remotely" by a sync adapter.

There a more reasons for showing notifications which are not implemented yet, for instance

A task alarm time passes::

A task may have one or more alert times, in which case a notification should be shown.

A task geo fence entered::

A task may have a location based reminder. If the location is approached a notification
should be shown.


In later versions we may support other sources like state transitions.

== Notification triggers

A notification trigger means an event which results in an update of the currently shown
notifications.

Currently we have three:

A task provider operation::

    We don't distinguish between UI operations and sync adapter operations. We should
    check if a "notification relevant" field has been updated. This way we can avoid
    notification updates in case only a field like "description" has been changed.

    The following fields are considered notification relevant:

    * title
    * dtstart
    * due
    * status
    * pinned
    * extended property for alarm
    * extended property for geo fences
    * [anything potentially showing in the notification, see open issues **Notification texts**]

    In order to save precious resources we only update task notifications which
    need to be updated.


The system has booted::

   After booting the system no notifications are shown and we have to restore them.
   Ideally we also restore start and due notifications which have not been
   dismissed yet.

The app has been updated::

   When the app is updated, it is first stopped, causing existing notifications to be
   removed. In that case we also have to restore the notifications.

In addition there is one future source planned:

A geo fence has been crossed::

   When the app is updated, it is first stopped, causing exiting notifications to be
   removed. In that case we also have to restore the notifications.


== Notification types

In OpenTasks we distinguish three notification types (channels/categories):

Alerts::

This channel contains notifications for alerts which depend on time, like start and due
notifications.
By default, this channel has a HIGH priority to show a heads up notification.

Reminders::

This channel contains custom user reminders like custom alarms and location based reminders.
By default, this channel has a HIGH priority to show a heads up notification.

Pin board::

This channel contains notifications for pinned tasks.
By default, this channel has a MEDIUM priority to make a sound but not
show a heads up notification.

== State diagram

The following graph shows the notification state diagram.

A task normally starts in the `No_Notification` state, though there may be exceptions, such as
when a new task is synced which is already pinned.
